Nawano provides a simple, fast and secure way of managing your Nano funds locally—without doing any syncing, and without having to trust a wallet provider on the *World Wide Web*.

Seeds are encrypted with AES-256 and never leaves your computer.

Node communication is done over RPC; locally or using a remote backend (such as Canoe).

Installing
----------

Available pip/install environment variables:
- `USE_GPU=1|0`
  * Linux: Install OpenCL libs and set to 1 to use the GPU for work generation
  * OSX: Should work directly with OS-default OpenCL libs, simply pass `USE_GPU=1` to pip3.
- `LINK_OMP=1|0`
  * Linux: Not used
  * OSX: Linking of libomp. Set to 0 to use gcc with builtin GOMP
- `CC=<path>`
  * ALL: Custom C compiler, instead of letting Nawano choose one for you
  
**Linux (Ubuntu)**

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install libb2-dev python3
$ sudo pip3 install nawano --upgrade
$ nawano
```

**MacOS**

```bash
$ brew install gcc libb2 libomp python3
$ sudo LINK_OMP=1 pip3 install nawano --upgrade
$ nawano
```

**Windows**

Nawano can be installed in Microsoft Windows using WSL.

1. Enable WSL: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10 
2. Using **Microsoft Store**, install **Ubuntu Linux** and start it.
3. Follow the **Ubuntu Linux** install instruction above.

You may now close the terminal window and simply run ```wsl nawano``` to start the application.


Project status
--------------

While Nawano does work, it's currently under heavy development and should probably be considered unstable as it lacks tests and extensive real-world use.
