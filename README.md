Nawano is a lightweight, secure and fast [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) command-line application that provides a simple and intuative interface for managing Nano funds.

Seeds are encrypted with AES-256 and stored along with information about derivate keys locally.

Please bare in mind that—just as the official Nano software—Nawano uses the *BSD 2-Clause License* (i.e. no liability for loss of funds).

- Don't have any Nano? You can get a small amount for testing purposes at [nano-faucet.org](https://nano-faucet.org)
